\section{Education}
\cventry{Fall 2008 - Winter 2012 (expected)}{Computer Science \& Mathematics, North Carolina State University}{Raleigh, NC}{}{Overall GPA: 3.949}{CSC \& MA Majors GPA: 4.0}
\section{Computer Skills} 
  \cvline{Languages:}{Python, Java, Go, JavaScript, C}
\section{Experience} 
  \cventry{Summer 2012}{Software Engineering Intern}{Google}{Mountain View, CA}{}{
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Rewrote Android Virtual Device (AVD) creation and management tools to focus on physical device specifications rather than the emulator's implementation details, allowing developers to create AVDs based on existing, real-world devices.
      \item Implemented an Android application that generated device specifications for use with the new toolset.
      \item Worked on an internal, company-wide communication app for Android as a side-project with another intern. Its design and implementation received positive remarks from a number of people, including Matias Duarte, Director of Android UI/UX.
    \end{itemize}
  }
  \cventry{Fall 2011}{Senior Design Team Lead}{Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab}{}{}{
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Developed a library for seamlessly interacting with Flicker, a project that allows for running trusted code modules on top of an extremely small trusted computing base.
      \item Implemented modules that wrap Intel's Trusted Platform Module's sealing and unsealing functionality.
      \item Developed modules that implement RSA and a corresponding arbitrary precision math library which do not depend on libc.
    \end{itemize}
  }
  \cventry{Summer 2011}{Technical Solutions Engineering Intern}{Google}{Mountain View, CA}{}{
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Extracted ChimpChat, a Java library for interfacing with the Monkey tool, from MonkeyRunner.
      \item Added view introspection functionality to Monkey, ChimpChat and MonkeyRunner.
      \item Worked on an SFTP server backed by Google technologies and infrastructure, improving read performance by 4x and implementing proper access control.
    \end{itemize}
  }
  \cventry{May 2010 --\\January 2011}{Research Professional}{Dr. Jiang, NCSU}{Raleigh, NC}{}{
    \begin{itemize}% \itemsep -2pt % reduce space between items
      \item Developed a framework to interpose advertisement's interaction with webpages.
      \item Gave presentations on papers and research proposals to the Systems Security group.
    \end{itemize}
  }
  \cventry{2008--2010}{Jr. Developer/IT Intern}{Futures, Inc.}{Durham, NC}{}{
    \begin{itemize}%  \itemsep -2pt %reduce space between items
        \item Aided in the design, and provided the implementation and support of a large scale (10,000+ initial users), Xen-virtualized server environment housing a rich internet web application.
	      \item Developed a custom continuous integration server that interfaced with our git repositories.
    \end{itemize}
